    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Much like Black Noir from "The Boys," I often find myself navigating life with an air of mystery.</p>
    <p>While not clad in a black costume, I do appreciate the power of discretion and keeping certain aspects of myself private.</p>
    <p>Like Black Noir's unwavering loyalty to Vought International,  I am fiercely dedicated to my commitments and responsibilities, always striving to fulfill them to the best of my abilities.</p>
    <p>My reserved nature may add an element of intrigue to those who know me, as they discover more about me over time, just as viewers of the series slowly uncover Black Noir's secrets.</p>
